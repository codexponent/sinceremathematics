# Sincere Mathematics
--------

For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in maths - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how itâ€™s used in Computer Science. This specialisation aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying maths, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.
